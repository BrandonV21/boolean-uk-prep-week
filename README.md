# Welcome to Prep Week!
As part of your preparation for starting the Software Developer course at Boolean, we'd like you to get some practice *forking* GitHub repositories. GitHub repositores are where you will store your code in practice exercises. *Forking* a repostiory means to make a copy of a repository and store it in your account. When you start doing exercises, you'll begin by forking a Boolean repoistory that contains the exercise instructions. 

Don't worry if that doesn't make sense at the moment! We'll cover it in much more detail later in the course. For now, follow the steps below so you understand the basic process to fork a reposirtory.
